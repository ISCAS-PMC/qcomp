EPMC is a probabilistic model checker written in JAVA with few C libraries.


*** Compilation of EPMC ***
EPMC compilation is based on Maven, which requires an active internet connection to download all needed components.
These are the steps to get and compile EPMC:

sudo apt-get install git maven make g++ default-jdk
git clone https://github.com/liyi-david/ePMC.git
cd ePMC
./build.sh

After quite some time, the jar file epmc-standard.jar is generated, which contains EPMC.
Please make sure EPMC is in the same directory you 


*** Verification of PLTL properties ***
In order to work with PLTL properties, EPMC makes use of SPOT to convert the LTL formula to a BÃ¼chi automaton.
SPOT is released under GPL v3 and it can be found at https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/index.html
To install it, just execute the following commands:

wget http://www.lrde.epita.fr/dload/spot/spot-2.6.3.tar.gz
tar xfz spot-2.6.3.tar.gz
cd spot-2.6.3
sudo apt-get install make g++
./configure --disable-python
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

The compilation of spot requires quite some time; replace "make" with "make -j n" for an appropriate value of "n" (like the number of CPU cores minus 1) to parallelize the compilation tasks.
** NOTE **
You do not have to install spot unless you want to verify PLTL properties with EPMC.
