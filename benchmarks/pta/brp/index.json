	"description": "A Modest PTA model of the bounded retransmission protocol [1], combining the previous untimed [2] and non-probabilistic [3] models. It models the transmission of one file from a sender to a receiver in `N´ chunks. The number of retransmissions per file is bounded by `MAX´, and the transmission delay of the probabilistic lossy channels between sender and receiver is `TD´.",
